# Voice Features for Financial Advisor Chat

## Overview

The Financial Advisor Chat now includes comprehensive voice functionality that supports multi-language interactions. Users can speak their questions and listen to AI responses in their preferred language.

## Features

### üé§ Voice Input (Speech Recognition)
- **Browser Support**: Works in modern browsers that support the Web Speech API
- **Multi-language**: Automatically detects and supports multiple languages
- **Real-time**: Converts speech to text in real-time
- **Visual Feedback**: Shows listening status with animated indicators

### üîä Audio Playback (Text-to-Speech)
- **Message Playback**: Every message (user and AI) has a play button
- **Natural Voices**: Uses the browser's built-in speech synthesis
- **Language Matching**: Speaks in the same language as the conversation
- **Play/Stop Control**: Click to start/stop audio playback

### üåç Multi-language Support
Supported languages include:
- English (en-US)
- Spanish (es-ES) 
- French (fr-FR)
- German (de-DE)
- Hindi (hi-IN)
- Telugu (te-IN)
- Kannada (kn-IN)
- Chinese (zh-CN)
- Japanese (ja-JP)

## How It Works

### Language Detection
1. When a user sends their first message, the system automatically detects the language
2. The conversation continues in that detected language
3. AI responses are provided in the same language
4. Voice features (input/output) use the detected language

### Voice Input Process
1. Click the microphone button in the chat header
2. Start speaking your financial question
3. The system converts speech to text
4. Click the microphone again to stop listening
5. Send the message as usual

### Audio Playback Process
1. Each message displays a small speaker icon
2. Click the speaker icon to hear the message
3. Click again to stop playback
4. Only one message can play at a time

## Technical Implementation

### Browser Compatibility
- **Speech Recognition**: Chrome, Edge, Safari (with webkit prefix)
- **Speech Synthesis**: All modern browsers
- **Fallback**: Features gracefully degrade if not supported

### Error Handling
- Permission denied for microphone access
- Network errors during speech recognition
- Audio playback failures
- Comprehensive error messages and user feedback

### Performance Considerations
- Lightweight implementation using native browser APIs
- No external dependencies for core voice functionality
- Efficient language detection algorithms
- Optimized audio playback timing

## Usage Tips

1. **For Best Voice Recognition**:
   - Speak clearly and at normal pace
   - Use good microphone or headset
   - Minimize background noise
   - Ensure browser has microphone permissions

2. **For Multi-language Conversations**:
   - Start your conversation in your preferred language
   - The system will maintain that language throughout
   - Financial terminology is supported in all languages

3. **For Audio Playback**:
   - Use headphones for better experience
   - Adjust browser volume settings as needed
   - Each message can be replayed multiple times

## Browser Permissions

The application requires microphone permissions for voice input:
1. Browser will prompt for permission on first use
2. Grant permission to enable voice input
3. Permissions can be managed in browser settings
4. Voice input gracefully disables if permission denied

## Accessibility

- Visual indicators for voice states
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatible
- High contrast compatible icons
- Descriptive tooltips and labels

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Offline voice recognition
- Custom voice models
- Voice command shortcuts
- Advanced language detection
- Voice training for better accuracy
- Audio message recording/playback
